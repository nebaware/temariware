See the list below.\n\n## Packages\n\n| Name                                           | Description                                                                                 |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`redis`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/redis)                    | The client with all the [\"redis-stack\"](https://github.com/redis-stack/redis-stack) modules |\n| [`@redis/client`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/client)           | The base clients (i.e `RedisClient`, `RedisCluster`, etc.)                                  |\n| [`@redis/bloom`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/bloom)             | [Redis Bloom](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/probabilistic/) commands                     |\n| [`@redis/json`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/json)               | [Redis JSON](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/json/) commands                               |\n| [`@redis/search`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/search)           | [RediSearch](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/) commands                     |\n| [`@redis/time-series`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/time-series) | [Redis Time-Series](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/timeseries/) commands                  |\n| [`@redis/entraid`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/entraid)         | Secure token-based authentication for Redis clients using Microsoft Entra ID                |\n\n> Looking for a high-level library to handle object mapping?\n> See [redis-om-node](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node)!\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Example\n\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from \"redis\";\n\nconst client = await createClient()\n  .on(\"error\", (err) => console.log(\"Redis Client Error\", err))\n  .connect();\n\nawait client.set(\"key\", \"value\");\nconst value = await client.get(\"key\");\nclient.destroy();\n```\n\nThe above code connects to localhost on port 6379. To connect to a different host or port, use a connection string in\nthe format `redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]`:\n\n```typescript\ncreateClient({\n  url: \"redis://alice:foobared@awesome.redis.server:6380\",\n});\n```\n\nYou can also use discrete parameters, UNIX sockets, and even TLS to connect. Details can be found in\nthe [client configuration guide](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/client-configuration.md).\n\nTo check if the the client is connected and ready to send commands, use `client.isReady` which returns a boolean.\n`client.isOpen` is also available. This returns `true` when the client's underlying socket is open, and `false` when it\nisn't (for example when the client is still connecting or reconnecting after a network error).\n\n### Redis Commands\n\nThere is built-in support for all of the [out-of-the-box Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands). They are exposed\nusing the raw Redis command names (`HSET`, `HGETALL`, etc.) and a friendlier camel-cased version (`hSet`, `hGetAll`,\netc.):\n\n```typescript\n// raw Redis commands\nawait client.HSET(\"key\", \"field\", \"value\");\nawait client.HGETALL(\"key\");\n\n// friendly JavaScript commands\nawait client.hSet(\"key\", \"field\", \"value\");\nawait client.hGetAll(\"key\");\n```\n\nModifiers to commands are specified using a JavaScript object:\n\n```typescript\nawait client.set(\"key\", \"value\", {\n  EX: 10,\n  NX: true,\n});\n```\n\nReplies will be transformed into useful data structures:\n\n```typescript\nawait client.hGetAll(\"key\"); // { field1: 'value1', field2: 'value2' }\nawait client.hVals(\"key\"); // ['value1', 'value2']\n```\n\n`Buffer`s are supported as well:\n\n```typescript\nconst client = createClient().withTypeMapping({\n  [RESP_TYPES.BLOB_STRING]: Buffer\n});\n\nawait client.hSet(\"key\", \"field\", Buffer.from(\"value\")); // 'OK'\nawait client.hGet(\"key\", \"field\"); // { field: <Buffer 76 61 6c 75 65> }\n\n```\n\n### Unsupported Redis Commands\n\nIf you want to run commands and/or use arguments that Node Redis doesn't know about (yet!) use `.sendCommand()`:\n\n```typescript\nawait client.sendCommand([\"SET\", \"key\", \"value\", \"NX\"]); // 'OK'\n\nawait client.sendCommand([\"HGETALL\", \"key\"]); // ['key1', 'field1', 'key2', 'field2']\n```\n\n### Transactions (Multi/Exec)\n\nStart a [transaction](https://redis.io/topics/transactions) by calling `.multi()`, then chaining your commands. When\nyou're done, call `.exec()` and you'll get an array back with your results:\n\n```typescript\nawait client.set(\"another-key\", \"another-value\");\n\nconst [setKeyReply, otherKeyValue] = await client\n  .multi()\n  .set(\"key\", \"value\")\n  .get(\"another-key\")\n  .exec(); // ['OK', 'another-value']\n```\n\nYou can also [watch](https://redis.io/topics/transactions#optimistic-locking-using-check-and-set) keys by calling\n`.watch()`. Your transaction will abort if any of the watched keys change.\n\n\n### Blocking Commands\n\nIn v4, `RedisClient` had the ability to create a pool of connections using an \"Isolation Pool\" on top of the \"main\"\nconnection. However, there was no way to use the pool without a \"main\" connection:\n\n```javascript\nconst client = await createClient()\n  .on(\"error\", (err) => console.error(err))\n  .connect();\n\nawait client.ping(client.commandOptions({ isolated: true }));\n```\n\nIn v5 we've extracted this pool logic into its own class—`RedisClientPool`:\n\n```javascript\nconst pool = await createClientPool()\n  .on(\"error\", (err) => console.error(err))\n  .connect();\n\nawait pool.ping();\n```\n\n\n### Pub/Sub\n\nSee the [Pub/Sub overview](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/pub-sub.md).\n\n### Scan Iterator\n\n[`SCAN`](https://redis.io/commands/scan) results can be looped over\nusing [async iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator):\n\n```typescript\nfor await (const key of client.scanIterator()) {\n  // use the key!\n  await client.get(key);\n}\n```\n\nThis works with `HSCAN`, `SSCAN`, and `ZSCAN` too:\n\n```typescript\nfor await (const { field, value } of client.hScanIterator(\"hash\")) {\n}\nfor await (const member of client.sScanIterator(\"set\")) {\n}\nfor await (const { score, value } of client.zScanIterator(\"sorted-set\")) {\n}\n```\n\nYou can override the default options by providing a configuration object:\n\n```typescript\nclient.scanIterator({\n  TYPE: \"string\", // `SCAN` only\n  MATCH: \"patter*\",\n  COUNT: 100,\n});\n```\n\n### Disconnecting\n\nThe `QUIT` command has been deprecated in Redis 7.2 and should now also be considered deprecated in Node-Redis. Instead\nof sending a `QUIT` command to the server, the client can simply close the network connection.\n\n`client.QUIT/quit()` is replaced by `client.close()`. and, to avoid confusion, `client.disconnect()` has been renamed to\n`client.destroy()`.\n\n```typescript\nclient.destroy();\n```\n### Client Side Caching\n\nNode Redis v5 adds support for [Client Side Caching](https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/), which enables clients to cache query results locally. The Redis server will notify the client when cached results are no longer valid.\n\n```typescript\n// Enable client side caching with RESP3\nconst client = createClient({\n  RESP: 3, \n  clientSideCache: {\n    ttl: 0,             // Time-to-live (0 = no expiration)\n    maxEntries: 0,      // Maximum entries (0 = unlimited)\n    evictPolicy: \"LRU\"  // Eviction policy: \"LRU\" or \"FIFO\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\nSee the [V5 documentation](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/v5.md#client-side-caching) for more details and advanced usage.\n\n### Auto-Pipelining\n\nNode Redis will automatically pipeline requests that are made during the same \"tick\".\n\n```typescript\nclient.set(\"Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==\", \"users:1\");\nclient.sAdd(\"users:1:tokens\", \"Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==\");\n```\n\nOf course, if you don't do something with your Promises you're certain to\nget [unhandled Promise exceptions](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_unhandledrejection). To take\nadvantage of auto-pipelining and handle your Promises, use `Promise.all()`.\n\n```typescript\nawait Promise.all([\n  client.set(\"Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==\", \"users:1\"),\n  client.sAdd(\"users:1:tokens\", \"Tm9kZSBSZWRpcw==\"),\n]);\n```\n\n### Programmability\n\nSee the [Programmability overview](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/programmability.md).\n\n### Clustering\n\nCheck out the [Clustering Guide](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/clustering.md) when using Node Redis to connect to a Redis Cluster.\n\n### Events\n\nThe Node Redis client class is an Nodejs EventEmitter and it emits an event each time the network status changes:\n\n| Name                    | When                                                                               | Listener arguments                                        |\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `connect`               | Initiating a connection to the server                                              | _No arguments_                                            |\n| `ready`                 | Client is ready to use                                                             | _No arguments_                                            |\n| `end`                   | Connection has been closed (via `.disconnect()`)                                   | _No arguments_                                            |\n| `error`                 | An error has occurred—usually a network issue such as \"Socket closed unexpectedly\" | `(error: Error)`                                          |\n| `reconnecting`          | Client is trying to reconnect to the server                                        | _No arguments_                                            |\n| `sharded-channel-moved` | See [here](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/pub-sub.md#sharded-channel-moved-event)                          | See [here](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/docs/pub-sub.md#sharded-channel-moved-event) |\n\n> :warning: You **MUST** listen to `error` events. If a client doesn't have at least one `error` listener registered and\n> an `error` occurs, that error will be thrown and the Node.js process will exit.
